/** @class
  A Pane is like a regular view except that it does not need to live within a 
  parent view.  You usually use a Pane to form the root of a view hierarchy in 
  your application, such as your main application view or for floating 
  palettes, popups, menus, etc.
  
  Usually you will not work directly with the SC.Pane class, but with one of 
  its subclasses such as SC.MainPane, SC.Panel, or SC.PopupPane.

  h1. Showing a Pane
  
  To make a pane visible, you need to add it to your HTML document.  The 
  simplest way to do this is to call the append() method:
  
  {{{
     myPane = SC.Pane.create();
     myPane.append(); // adds the pane to the document
  }}}
  
  This will insert your pane into the end of your HTML document body, causing 
  it to display on screen.  It will also register your pane with the 
  SC.RootResponder for the document so you can start to receive keyboard, 
  mouse, and touch events.
  
  If you need more specific control for where you pane appears in the 
  document, you can use several other insertion methods such as appendTo(), 
  prependTo(), before() and after().  These methods all take a an element to 
  indicate where in your HTML document you would like you pane to be inserted.
  
  Once a pane is inserted into the document, it will be sized and positioned 
  according to the layout you have specified.  It will then automatically 
  resize with the window if needed, relaying resize notifications to children 
  as well.
  
  h1. Hiding a Pane
  
  When you are finished with a pane, you can hide the pane by calling the 
  remove() method.  This method will actually remove the Pane from the 
  document body, as well as deregistering it from the RootResponder so that it 
  no longer receives events.
  
  The isVisibleInWindow method will also change to NO for the Pane and all of 
  its childViews and the views will no longer have their updateDisplay methods 
  called.  
  
  You can readd a pane to the document again any time in the future by using 
  any of the insertion methods defined in the previous section.
  
  h1. Receiving Events
  
  Your pane and its child views will automatically receive any mouse or touch 
  events as long as it is on the screen.  To receive keyboard events, however, 
  you must focus the keyboard on your pane by calling makeKeyPane() on the 
  pane itself.  This will cause the RootResponder to route keyboard events to 
  your pane.  The pane, in turn, will route those events to its current 
  keyView, if there is any.
  
  Note that all SC.Views (anything that implements SC.ClassicResponder, 
  really) will be notified when it is about or gain or lose keyboard focus.  
  These notifications are sent both when the view is made keyView of a 
  particular pane and when the pane is made keyPane for the entire 
  application.
  
  You can prevent your Pane from becoming key by setting the acceptsKeyPane 
  to NO on the pane.  This is useful when creating palettes and other popups 
  that should not steal keyboard control from another view.
